*Sending Growl Messages via Scala*

About
_____
This library allows an application to simply send notifications to the [Growl][1] system.

The core of this library is based off of the Java code created by Tobias 
SÃ¶dergren in this [blog entry][1] 

Usage Notes
___________

This library will currently only work with a Java 6 or greater VM 
(though, it still needs to be tested with Java 7).

More importantly, this will only operate on Mac OS X, with Growl installed.
