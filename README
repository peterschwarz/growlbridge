The core of thise library is based off of the Java code created by Tobias 
SÃ¶dergren in a blog entry located at:

Note:  This library will currently only work with a Java 6 or greater VM 
(though, it still needs to be tested with Java 7).

More importantly, this will only operate on Mac OS X, with Growl installed. 

Growl may be found here:
